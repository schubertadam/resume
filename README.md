# resume
I decided to write a new CV for two reasons:
1. because my old one is pretty old (between 1 and 2 years).
2. I could not found anything which suits my taste.

There is absolutely no requirements to edit the file. All you
 need is a text editor (notepad++, VSC, etc.), and you can work with it.

If you want to have a nice and easily editable resume, please feel free to download it.
If you like it, then please leave a star :)
